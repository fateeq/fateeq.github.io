            <p>I'm Farah. Formally, I'm trained as a scientist and hold an MSc in Chemistry from Waterloo, ON. My most recent position was as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist for a veterinary pharmaceutical company. Recently, I voluntarily left this position to pursue a career in tech.</p>  
            <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my position as a Regulatory Affairs Specialist because I got to immerse myself in many different tasks including data analysis, project management, technical writing, improving company processes, and understanding industry and government regulations. My favorite parts of the job were finding trends in data, and improving work flow (e.g., finding a quicker way to validate data), both of which require analytical thinking. These interests led me to dabble in programming on the side during my off hours. Programming isn't new to me. It's something I've done on and off since I was a teenager - thanks to older siblings who went to college for computer science and fascinated me with the skills they brought home. I was able to focus on programming a lot more this time round though, having found some very useful personal applications for it. I realized I loved it so much that I wanted to turn it into a career. Due to a long commute that was eating up a lot of my time (and money!) I decided leaving my job and pursuing tech full-time would be a better investment of my time.</p>
            <p>I am currently taking online courses in web development and data science to fully utilize my logical and creative sides, with the goal to help solve problems that I am passionate about. I am extremely excited about this new career choice and keen to contribute to the tech community. As a chemist, I was consistently recognized for being a quick learner, strong team player, reliable in any situation and very organized. These qualities will help me bring my A-game to tech.</p>
            <p>Outside work I like camping, hiking, crafting, cooking and reading.</p>

                  <div class="text-left">
                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Impurity Calculator is a JavaScript application I created to practice the beginner materials I learnt in my courses. The inspiration for this application came from a problem I faced often at work. The application is essentially a clean-looking, error-free alternative to the spreadsheet calculations my colleagues had to perform and that I had to review.</p>
                    <p>*While I drew inspiration from problems at work, this application was created solely for my practice at my own time and is not associated with my work.*</p>
                    <ul class="list-inline">
                      <li>Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                      <li>Time spent: 20 hours</li>
                      <li>Completed: Dec 2018</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01-full.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>You can interact with the application <a href="ImpurityCalculator/index.html">here</a> and view the code on GitHub.</p>
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>Before releasing a product for sale, one of the tests that had to be performed on the product was measuring the levels of impurities in it and ensuring they were within specifications. The test was performed by lab analysts using a chemical instrument, which printed off raw data in the form of peak areas. The analysts would perform calculations on the raw data using a spreadsheet to get the impurity levels, then transcribe the results onto a specification sheet. The QA department (and sometimes me) reviewed the data before approving it.</p>
                    <p>During the QA, several mistakes were always discovered. These mistakes were initiated throughout the data’s journey, from the raw data being manually typed into the spreadsheet, the calculations performed in the spreadsheet, and handwriting the results onto the specification sheet. Most of the issues arose within the spreadsheet itself, for example, not using the correct cell references, or forgetting to exclude impurities that were less than reporting limits from the total impurities calculations, or reporting numbers to incorrect decimal places.</p>
                    <p>It was a frustrating process that I wanted to do something about.</p>
                    <h4>A solution that turned out to be another problem</h4>
                    <p>A simple solution was to create a spreadsheet myself and lock all cells except where raw data had to be input. It took me a few hours to finally create a spreadsheet that looked decent and could perform all the calculations I needed it to. Over the next few weeks, as I started to validate my own spreadsheet with data received from the lab, I noticed several errors that I constantly kept correcting, errors such as not copying a formula over from one cell to the next or referencing the wrong cell. I found the whole process very tedious and working with cells very limiting. I ended up keeping the spreadsheet to myself and didn’t share it with other reviewers, as it seemed too complicated to explain it to colleagues who often got frustrated with technology anyway.</p>  
                    <h4>A better solution</h4>
                    <p>Trying to perform the above calculations in a spreadsheet is one of the big problems that inspired me to get back into programming. I really wanted to create a clean-looking application that takes input from the user, performs calculations behind the scenes, and neatly outputs the correct results. I started building the Impurity Calculator at this point. It was the perfect opportunity to practice working with variables, if-else statements, loops, and arrays, as well as a bit of HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>Creating the JavaScript application was not easier than creating the Excel spreadsheet, but the product looked a lot cleaner and gave me more confidence as it had less errors, thanks to looping.</p>
                    <h4>Future Work</h4>
                    <p>While my application is not perfect, I am happy with the amount of practice I received working on it. I decided to move on to more advanced sections of my course and learn better ways of writing code. I will be visiting this application, or something very similar to it, in the future and challenge myself to build it in a better way using ES 6-9, frameworks and libraries.</p>

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Trip Listings app is a React project I worked on using create-react-app, as part of my Udemy web development course. The app lists a bunch of trips that I made up and displays them neatly in a responsive web page. There is also a function which can search trips by name.</p>
                      <ul class="list-inline">
                      <li>Tools used: React.js, creat-react-app, NPM, Node.js</li>
                      <li>Time spent: 1 week</li>
                      <li>Completed: Jan 2019</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The app is not hosted online yet, but you can view the code on GitHub and some of the screenshots below.</p>
